### Lancet

Lancet: [The Pandemic Treaty: shameful and unjust](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00410-0/fulltext)

Notes: The Lancet basically says this effort is not enough. The Lancet's article promots the legal binding aspect of such efforts.


> The Lancet's article criticizes the current efforts as insufficient and emphasizes the importance of making the pandemic treaty legally binding. It argues that stronger, enforceable commitments are necessary to ensure equitable access to resources and effective global health security measures. The article expresses concern that the current draft of the treaty lacks the robust legal obligations needed to address the gaps in pandemic response and preparedness adequately.
