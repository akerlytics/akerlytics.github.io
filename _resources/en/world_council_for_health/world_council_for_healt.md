Taken from Wikipedia:

> Formation	September 2021; 2 years ago
<br>
Type	Nonprofit
<br>
Headquarters	Bath, England
<br>
Website	https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/
<br><br>
The World Council for Health is a pseudo-medical organisation dedicated to spreading misinformation to discourage COVID-19 vaccination, and promoting fake COVID-19 treatments.[1]
<br><br>
The organization's online appearance is that of a mainstream health organization.[2] It appears to have been formed in September 2021 and its published leadership contains people which an Australian Associated Press fact check described as "figures who have promoted unfounded conspiracy theories".[3] The group was founded by Jennifer A. Hibberd and Tess Lawrie, an obstetrician and founder of the "BIRD Group", which erroneously promotes ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment.[4]
<br><br>
The World Council for Health is affiliated with Children's Health Defense, an antivaccine association led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.[5]

Note on the strong etiquette put on this organization. This etiquette is in part due to their suggestion to use _Ivermectin_ to combat Covid-19. Here are the sources used for this etiquette:

We will track all arguments against the validity of this organization on this page.
