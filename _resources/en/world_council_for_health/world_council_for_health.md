## Validity Challenged by Wikipedia

<!-- Note: Please refer to our notes on: 
- [Wikipedia](/resources/wikipedia), its pros and cons.
- [Professionals](/resources/professionals/) and our use of resources. -->

See: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Council_for_Health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Council_for_Health)

Taken from Wikipedia:

> Formation	September 2021; 2 years ago
<br>
Type	Nonprofit
<br>
Headquarters	Bath, England
<br>
Website	https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/
<br><br>
The World Council for Health is a pseudo-medical organisation dedicated to spreading misinformation to discourage COVID-19 vaccination, and promoting fake COVID-19 treatments.[1]
<br><br>
The organization's online appearance is that of a mainstream health organization.[2] It appears to have been formed in September 2021 and its published leadership contains people which an Australian Associated Press fact check described as "figures who have promoted unfounded conspiracy theories".[3] The group was founded by Jennifer A. Hibberd and Tess Lawrie, an obstetrician and founder of the "BIRD Group", which erroneously promotes ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment.[4]
<br><br>
The World Council for Health is affiliated with Children's Health Defense, an antivaccine association led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.[5]

Note on the strong etiquette put on this organization. This etiquette is in part due to their suggestion to use _Ivermectin_ to combat Covid-19. Here are the sources used for this etiquette:

We will track all arguments against the validity of this organization on this page. See this next section or using the link: [rebuttal-to-wikipedias-page-on-wch](#rebuttal-to-wikipedias-page-on-wch)

### Rebuttal to Wikipedia's page on WCH

<!-- See the section dedicated to [Wikipedia](/resources/wikipedia) where we explain why the information there is demoted to lower influence in relation to these efforts. -->

See the [Talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:World_Council_for_Health) section of Wikipedia to see their current discussions of their content.

From the "Talk" section of Wikipedia, this article of counter arguments to WCH is advanced: [Ivermectin is the new hydroxychloroquine, take 3: Conspiracy theories vs. science](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/ivermectin-is-the-new-hydroxychloroquine-take-3-conspiracy-theories-vs-science/)

#### Ivermectin

The introduction of the Wikipedia entry says:
> which erroneously promotes ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment. [citing: Kerr et al. 2022, Hume 2022, Merlan 2021]

See next section [Studies Analysis](#studies-analysis) where 103 studies on Ivermectin are tracked and analysed.

### Studies Analysis

See [Ivermectin for COVID-19: real-time meta analysis of 103 studies](https://c19ivm.org/meta.html)

See the entry for Ivermectin's time to when studies showed efficacy: [Time when COVID-19 studies showed efficacy](https://c19early.org/timeline.html), where relevant data existed at the end of 2020.
