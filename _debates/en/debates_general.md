# Debates on the issue of WHO's dual documents signature

Here are the subsections of this platform for debating the issue:

- [Petitions](/petitions/)
- [Arguments](/debates/arguments)
- [Canadian Law References](/law/can)

See [Petitions-UK](/petitions/uk) where the same points of concern are very well presented and argued in the English *senate*.


## Arguments

The section on the arguments is meant to communicate which argument is countering, some history, and the ranking according to demogratic vote of importance. Data and ranking of Profetionnals will have it's own cathegory.


## Canadian Law

Go to [Canadian Law](/law/can) section.

See the connected project for accessing and working with law data.
