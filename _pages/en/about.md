<!-- #endregion -->

This document provides an overview of the current efforts of the WHO to develop and amend key international instruments related to global public health, including the International Health Regulations (IHR) and the International Treaty on Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response.

<!-- @optional
as well as the critical role of non-governmental organizations like the World Council for Health in providing counter-arguments and evidence-based recommendations. Selected quotes present concerns about the influence of financial contributions on WHO decisions and the importance of maintaining national sovereignty in the face of international pressures to adopt these new legal instruments.

### The two active WHO documents
<!-- #region -->
<!-- #endregion -->

The two following documents are in the final stretch to being signed in May 2024. These documents represent critical components of the World Health Organization's (WHO) ongoing efforts to strengthen global health security and governance. The International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) and the International Treaty on Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response (Pandemic Treaty) are of the order of establishing a framework for international cooperation and response to public health emergencies. The development and amendment of these documents involve extensive negotiations and consultations with member states, reflecting the collective ambition to enhance global preparedness against future pandemics. These efforts underscore the importance of a coordinated international approach to public health threats, emphasizing the need for transparency, equity, and shared responsibility.

1. **International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR)**
   - Entity in charge: Working Group on Amendments to the International Health Regulations (WGIHR).
   - [More information on WGIHR](https://apps.who.int/gb/wgihr/)

2. **International Treaty on Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response** (Pandemic Treaty)
   - Entity in charge: Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB).
   - [More information on INB](https://inb.who.int/)

Our concern here is that the consultations of member states doesn't automatically ensure proper discussions and debates are done by the member states with their respective populations. The democratic process requires not just the involvement of government officials and health experts but also the engagement of the public in meaningful ways. It is essential that these significant health governance instruments are subject to open, transparent, and inclusive debate within each country, allowing for a broad range of voices to be heard. This ensures that the policies and agreements forged at the international level truly reflect the will and the needs of the people they affect, safeguarding democratic principles in global health decision-making.

Our concern here is that the consultations of member states don't automatically ensure proper discussions and debates are conducted by the member states with their respective populations. The democratic process demands that such significant international agreements undergo thorough public scrutiny and debate within each country. This is crucial to ensure that the voices of the citizens are heard and that their concerns and perspectives are taken into account before such treaties are ratified. The essence of democracy is not just in the act of voting but in continuous and informed participation of the public in decisions that affect their lives and futures. Therefore, it is imperative that member states commit to engaging their populations in meaningful dialogue about these documents, to uphold the principles of democracy and ensure that international health policies are aligned with the will and welfare of the people.
