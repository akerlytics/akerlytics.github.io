## Purpose of the Research

### The two active WHO documents

The following two documents are in the final stretch before their signature in May 2024. These documents represent crucial components of the World Health Organization's (WHO) ongoing efforts to strengthen global health security and governance. The International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) and the International Treaty on Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response (Pandemic Treaty) are essential for establishing a framework for international cooperation and response to public health emergencies. The development and amendment of these documents involve extensive negotiations and consultations with member states, reflecting the collective ambition to improve global preparedness against future pandemics. These efforts underline the importance of a coordinated international approach to public health threats, focusing on the need for transparency, equity, and shared responsibility.

#### IHR
