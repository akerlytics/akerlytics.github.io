## Research Objective

Two documents from the World Health Organization (WHO) are currently being developed and will be signed into law by Canada on May 22, 2024. Updates are expected at this date:

- **Ninth meeting**: March 18–29, 2024

These meetings are organized by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB), see next section for link to INB.

### The two active WHO documents

The two following documents are in the final stretch to being signed in May 2024. These documents represent critical components of the World Health Organization's (WHO) ongoing efforts to strengthen global health security and governance. The International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) and the International Treaty on Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response (Pandemic Treaty) are of the order of establishing a framework for international cooperation and response to public health emergencies. The development and amendment of these documents involve extensive negotiations and consultations with member states, reflecting the collective ambition to enhance global preparedness against future pandemics. These efforts underscore the importance of a coordinated international approach to public health threats, emphasizing the need for transparency, equity, and shared responsibility.
