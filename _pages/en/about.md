# Political Issue Watch - CAN

Welcome to the **Political Issue Watch** platform for Canadian issues.

Current issue:
> Proposed amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR) and the delegation of powers to the World Health Organization (WHO) in the event of a global or national pandemic.

The IHR are an instrument of international law that is legally-binding on 196 State Parties, including the 194 WHO Member States. The IHR, in their version adopted in 2005, have been amended twice – in 2014 and 2022 (the most-recent amendments will come into force in May 2024). The newest proposed amendments come in response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The World Health Assembly mandated the INB to submit its final outcome to the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly in May 2024.

## Purpose of the Research

### The two active WHO documents

The following two documents are in the final stretch before their signature in May 2024. These documents represent crucial components of the World Health Organization's (WHO) ongoing efforts to strengthen global health security and governance. The International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) and the International Treaty on Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response (Pandemic Treaty) are essential for establishing a framework for international cooperation and response to public health emergencies. The development and amendment of these documents involve extensive negotiations and consultations with member states, reflecting the collective ambition to improve global preparedness against future pandemics. These efforts underline the importance of a coordinated international approach to public health threats, focusing on the need for transparency, equity, and shared responsibility.

#### IHR
