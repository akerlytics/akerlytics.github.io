This document provides an overview of the current efforts of the WHO to develop and amend key international instruments related to global public health, including the International Health Regulations (IHR) and the International Treaty on Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response. It highlights key meetings, the entities in charge, and the important documents associated with these efforts. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of public engagement and parliamentary debate regarding these developments,

<!-- @optional
as well as the critical role of non-governmental organizations like the World Council for Health in providing counter-arguments and evidence-based recommendations. Selected quotes present concerns about the influence of financial contribute on WHO decisions and the importance of maintaining national sovereignty in the face of international pressures to adopt these new legal instruments.

The two following documents are in the final stretch to being signed in May 2024. These documents represent critical components of the World Health Organization's (WHO) ongoing efforts to strengthen global health security and governance. The International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) and the International Treaty on Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response (Pandemic Treaty) are of the order of establishing a framework for international cooperation and response to public health emergencies. The development and amendment of these documents involve extensive negotiations and consultations with member states, reflecting the collective ambition to enhance global preparedness against future pandemics. These efforts underscore the importance of a coordinated international approach to public health threats, emphasizing the need for transparency, equity, and shared responsibility.

> A group of experts in political science and law prepared a comprehensive 45-page policy brief on the proposed amendments to the International Health Regulations (2005) and the WHO's pandemic treaty/agreement (WHO CA+). This brief provides a professional overview of the proposed legal instruments. It also presents a historical account of mistakes made during the COVID pandemic, describes attempts to establish these mistakes as accepted norms, and provides valuable insights on how to correct course before it's too late. The central points of the brief are summarized below for your convenience.

> It is noteworthy in this context that the WHO only has full control over roughly a quarter of its own budget. The rest consists of earmarked voluntary contribute by its funders. If agreed upon, some of the IHR (2005) amendments would enable the special interests that have compromised the organisation (see e.g. Cohen & Carter 2010) to standardise and impose how states and even non-state actors worldwide shall respond to public health emergencies and approach a variety of global health matters in general.
