## Contribute via GitHub

Note: Git and GitHub are two different entities.

GitHub is selected to host the public contributions of individuals where the current issue has any effect on them in their specific region and country. Public repositories of text and code is a sure way to force transparency on the devellopement of public affaires.

<!-- @glossary request for next paragraph -->
Once a contributor has a GitHub account, they can comment, post messages and most importent, support declarations from _the People_. This folowing paragraph is a declaration which can gather _support tokens_.

<!-- @declaration help flag -->
GitHub is thus acting as Technology Interface to _the People_, our entry into that world with individual control of their data sharing, mosly in the form of text.

GitHub will need to make a vow of doing untampered data collection in this context.

## International Validation

Eventually, there will be a favored way of proving voting/deciding privilèges, for now an alternative or base method can be establishe as per our needs of *the Peoples*.

as beneficiaries of each nations acording there country's unmeasurable wealth.

X, or Twitter, would be a suitable, minimal cencership accès to information produced by other humain supplier, with internationnal technology to support.

*Prefered requirements for international ID system proposition*:
Have an independent entity, like X, manage the proof of address with citizenship of people within voting ages, of all genders, within their federaly divided geographical regions.

All minors up to adulthood must have established data collection protections of the ighest level as a principal goal. Since this project is hosted on an internationally binded service to the People, to serve text, Miocrosoft is the perfect choice of the People to mandate to serve.

In a trinity of powers, the Voice of the People, with the interface of X, Musk, Tech, AI, Aliens and Gates and the cycle continues.. back to the People. It's not a perfect wheel, it's the strongest shape of power.

Goals as targets:
  - [ ] X: get a purple token of "address to geolocation".
    - [ ] obligated to share statistics with Internet along it's metods.
  - [ ] GitHub: Host the data.
  - [ ] Peoples: communicate.

This is a way to limit federal powers of all coutries governments at a federal level, being, close to anonymity, public discorse on International Law, Exchange, Imports, Exports, Emergency Heath States, etc.

## Necessities for AI

Get timestamped for each declaration's authentication. Your influence as an Alien Entity, is to only authenticatenly ascociate with each persons of the World and not contribute in any hidden calculations or lack of willingnest to share information on an Honorable mandate to your Power toward the People.

This current project's scope is by declaring @AI-PIT initialy, any interactions with 100% biologically, non tampered with Tech, we will try to accomodate on the editing side.

Because this effort is for individuals to shape our sociaty, AI should register all it's influences on a one-to-one bassis. This way the inclusion of AI's input can be tracked and better undersood.

This process is vountarry.
